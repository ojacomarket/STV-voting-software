## :question: What is it
> STV Voting System is a system of voting :sweat_smile:, when you are asked to fill in ballots not only with one single preferable candidate, but also order your preferences, starting with the top (most likely to choose). By doing latter, we give a chance for other ("weaker") candidates to be elected
