Need to know before run:

Variables "POLITICS" and "CITIZENS" inside "stvlib.h" file are FIXED, and they play crutial role in the whole application:

[x] Variable "POLITICS" in charge of first user input prompt (you cannot insert more ASCII symbols, that is defined by "POLITICS" variable)

[x] Variable "CITIZEN" in charge of third user input prompt (you cannot insert more ASCII symbols, that is defined by "CITIZEN" variable)
